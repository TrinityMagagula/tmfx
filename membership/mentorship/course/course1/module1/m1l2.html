    <h2>Lesson 2: History and Evolution of Forex Trading</h2>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>🕰️ The Origins of Currency Exchange</h2>
      <p>Before money, humans relied on the <span class="highlight">barter system</span>, exchanging goods and services directly. However, this method had limitations: it required a "double coincidence of wants"—both parties had to want what the other offered.</p>
      <p>The invention of money—starting with commodities like salt and cowry shells—revolutionized trade. Eventually, civilizations introduced metal coins (gold, silver, copper) for consistency and trust in value.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong> In ancient Mesopotamia (around 3000 BCE), silver bars were used for large transactions, and clay tablets recorded debt and trade deals.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>💰 The Gold Standard Era</h3>
      <p>By the 19th century, most major economies adopted the <span class="highlight">Gold Standard</span>. This meant each country's currency was backed by a fixed amount of gold, ensuring long-term price stability and promoting trust in international trade.</p>
      <p>This system helped industrial economies like Britain, France, and the US expand global trade by maintaining predictable exchange rates.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🛡️ Reduced inflation risk</li>
        <li>🔗 Created fixed currency relationships</li>
        <li>📉 Limited central bank interference</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong> If the British pound was pegged to gold at £1 = 1/4 ounce of gold and the US dollar at $1 = 1/20 ounce of gold, the exchange rate would naturally be £1 = $5.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>🏦 Bretton Woods Agreement (1944)</h3>
      <p>After World War II devastated global economies, leaders from 44 Allied nations met in Bretton Woods to prevent future financial chaos. They designed a new monetary system, with the <span class="highlight">U.S. dollar as the central reference currency</span>, pegged to gold.</p>
      <p>Other countries fixed their currencies to the dollar, creating a stable environment for post-war rebuilding.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Key Institutions Formed:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>🌍 <strong>IMF (International Monetary Fund)</strong> — to monitor exchange rates</li>
          <li>🏛️ <strong>World Bank</strong> — to fund reconstruction projects</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>📉 Collapse of Bretton Woods & Rise of Floating Currencies</h3>
      <p>By the 1960s, the U.S. was printing more dollars than it had gold, mainly due to Vietnam War spending. In 1971, President Nixon <span class="highlight">suspended gold convertibility</span>, ending the Bretton Woods system.</p>
      <p>This gave birth to the <strong>floating exchange rate system</strong>, where currency prices are determined by supply and demand in the open market.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Impact:</strong> Major currencies like the USD, JPY, GBP, and EUR now fluctuate freely based on trade balances, interest rates, and investor sentiment.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>💻 The Digital Age: 1990s Onward</h3>
      <p>The emergence of personal computers and the internet brought <span class="highlight">Forex to the masses</span>. Previously exclusive to large banks and institutions, Forex became accessible to individuals.</p>
      <p>Brokers started offering margin accounts, allowing traders to control large positions with small deposits. Leverage attracted retail traders globally.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💼 Introduction of retail brokers like FXCM, OANDA, and IG</li>
        <li>📈 Charting software improved analysis</li>
        <li>🤖 Automated systems (EAs) grew in popularity</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong> A trader with $1000 could use 1:100 leverage to trade $100,000 worth of currency. This potential increased both profits and risks.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>📲 The 21st Century Forex Revolution</h3>
      <p>Today’s Forex market is ultra-fast, highly liquid, and open 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. The daily trading volume exceeds <span class="highlight">$7 trillion</span>.</p>
      <p>Traders use smartphones, tablets, and advanced trading apps. Mobile trading has democratized access further, especially in emerging markets like Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🤳 Apps like MetaTrader 5 and cTrader enable on-the-go trades</li>
        <li>🧠 AI tools analyze data and detect patterns</li>
        <li>🌐 Forex influencers, educators, and online academies now thrive</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong> In South Africa, the number of online Forex traders has doubled since 2020 due to easy mobile access and rising financial literacy.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>📉 Crisis Events That Shaped Forex</h3>
      <p>Global financial events have repeatedly impacted currency markets. Understanding these can help traders anticipate volatility.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💣 <strong>2008 Global Financial Crisis:</strong> USD gained as a safe haven.</li>
        <li>🇬🇧 <strong>Brexit Referendum (2016):</strong> GBP dropped 10% overnight.</li>
        <li>🦠 <strong>COVID-19 Pandemic:</strong> Massive swings in all currencies as investors sought USD liquidity.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Lesson:</strong> Forex is deeply influenced by political, economic, and social factors. Traders must follow global news closely.
      </div>

      <h3>🧠 Beginner vs Intermediate Insight</h3>
      <p><strong>For Beginners:</strong> Knowing this history helps you respect how structured and massive the market is. It isn’t random — every rate reflects years of evolution.</p>
      <p><strong>For Intermediates:</strong> Pay attention to how changes in policy, technology, or trust (e.g., in central banks) influenced trading. This will help in understanding price behavior during news events.</p>
