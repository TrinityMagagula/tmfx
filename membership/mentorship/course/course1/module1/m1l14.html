    <h2>Lesson 14: Line, Bar, and Candlestick Charts</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ“Š Introduction: What Are Chart Types?</h2>
      <p>Charts are essential tools for any trader to visualize price movements in the market. Different chart types provide distinct perspectives on the same data, making it easier for traders to make informed decisions. In this lesson, we will cover the three most common chart types used in trading: <strong>Line Charts</strong>, <strong>Bar Charts</strong>, and <strong>Candlestick Charts</strong>.</p>
      <p>Each chart type has its unique way of displaying price data, and understanding these differences is key to becoming proficient in chart analysis.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ“ˆ Line Chart</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Line Chart</strong> is one of the simplest chart types. It connects the closing prices of a particular asset over time with a continuous line. This chart is ideal for tracking the overall direction of the price but does not give detailed information on price fluctuations during the trading session.</p>
      
      <h3>How to Read a Line Chart:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Price Movements:</strong> The line shows the overall price trend over time. It helps identify whether the price is moving up, down, or sideways.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Scale:</strong> The x-axis represents the time period, while the y-axis shows the price level.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        If you see a line chart showing the EUR/USD pair, a rising line suggests that the price of EUR/USD is increasing over time, while a falling line indicates a decrease.
      </div>

      <div class="chart-container">
        <div class="chart">
          <h3>Example of a Line Chart</h3>
          <img src="https://example.com/line-chart.jpg" alt="Line Chart Example">
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ“‰ Bar Chart</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Bar Chart</strong> displays more detailed information than a line chart. Each vertical bar represents the price range for a specific time period, such as a day, hour, or minute.</p>

      <h3>How to Read a Bar Chart:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Open and Close Prices:</strong> The left side of the bar represents the opening price, while the right side shows the closing price.</li>
        <li><strong>High and Low Prices:</strong> The vertical line of the bar represents the highest and lowest prices reached during that time period.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Scale:</strong> Like the line chart, the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents price.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        In a bar chart, if the bar shows that the opening price was lower than the closing price, it indicates a bullish (upward) trend. Conversely, if the opening price was higher than the closing price, it shows a bearish (downward) trend.
      </div>

      <div class="chart-container">
        <div class="chart">
          <h3>Example of a Bar Chart</h3>
          <img src="https://example.com/bar-chart.jpg" alt="Bar Chart Example">
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ“ˆ Candlestick Chart</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Candlestick Chart</strong> is similar to the bar chart but is more visually informative. Each candlestick represents the open, high, low, and close prices for a given time period. Candlestick charts are very popular because they offer more details about price movements than a line or bar chart, making them more useful for analyzing market behavior.</p>

      <h3>How to Read a Candlestick Chart:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong> The body of the candlestick represents the price range between the opening and closing prices. If the body is filled (usually in red or black), the close is lower than the open, indicating a bearish move. If the body is hollow or colored in green or white, the close is higher than the open, indicating a bullish move.</li>
        <li><strong>Wicks (Shadows):</strong> The thin lines above and below the body represent the high and low prices for the time period.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Scale:</strong> Like other charts, the x-axis shows the time, and the y-axis shows the price.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A candlestick with a long body and no wicks indicates that the price moved strongly in one direction during the time period. Short wicks suggest that the price stayed close to the open and close prices.
      </div>

      <div class="chart-container">
        <div class="chart">
          <h3>Example of a Candlestick Chart</h3>
          <img src="https://example.com/candlestick-chart.jpg" alt="Candlestick Chart Example">
        </div>

    <section>
      <h2>ðŸ”Ž Comparison of Chart Types</h2>
      <p>Each chart type has its strengths and is useful in different scenarios. Here's a quick comparison:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Line Chart:</strong> Great for identifying overall trends. Best for beginners who want a simple view of price direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Offers more details about price movement within a time period. It is useful for intermediate traders who need more information about price action.</li>
        <li><strong>Candlestick Chart:</strong> Provides the most detailed analysis of price action and is preferred by most experienced traders due to its ability to display trends and reversals more clearly.</li>
      </ul>
