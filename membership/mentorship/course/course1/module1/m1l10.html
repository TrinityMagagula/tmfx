    <h2>Lesson 10: Pips, Lots, and Leverage</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>üìå Introduction</h2>
      <p>In this lesson, we‚Äôll cover three of the most important building blocks of Forex trading: <strong>Pips, Lots, and Leverage</strong>. Understanding these concepts is essential for calculating profits and losses, managing risk, and making informed trading decisions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üîπ What is a Pip?</h2>
      <p><strong>PIP</strong> stands for ‚Äú<em>Percentage in Point</em>‚Äù or ‚Äú<em>Price Interest Point</em>‚Äù. A pip is the smallest price change in the exchange rate of a currency pair. Most currency pairs are quoted to four decimal places, and a pip is typically <span class="highlight">0.0001</span>.</p>

      <p>However, for currency pairs involving the Japanese Yen (JPY), a pip is equal to <span class="highlight">0.01</span> because they are quoted to two decimal places.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        If EUR/USD moves from <strong>1.1000</strong> to <strong>1.1001</strong>, that‚Äôs a 1 pip movement.<br>
        If USD/JPY moves from <strong>110.00</strong> to <strong>110.01</strong>, that‚Äôs a 1 pip movement.
      </div>

      <p><strong>Pip Value:</strong> The value of a pip depends on the <em>lot size</em> of your trade and the currency pair you are trading.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>üîπ What is a Lot?</h2>
        <p>
          In Forex trading, a <strong>lot</strong> is the standardized unit of measurement for a trade size. Instead of buying or selling single units of currency, traders use lots to express how much of a currency pair they are trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding lot sizes is essential for managing risk and calculating profits or losses in trading.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Types of Lots:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Standard Lot</strong> = 100,000 units of the base currency</li>
          <li><strong>Mini Lot</strong> = 10,000 units</li>
          <li><strong>Micro Lot</strong> = 1,000 units</li>
          <li><strong>Nano Lot</strong> = 100 units (very small, mainly used in cent or demo accounts)</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Lot Size and Pip Value:</h3>
        <p>
          A <strong>pip</strong> is the smallest price movement in most Forex pairs ‚Äî typically 0.0001. The value of a pip depends on the lot size you‚Äôre trading.
        </p>
      
        <div class="example-box">
          <strong>Examples of Pip Value per Lot:</strong><br>
          ‚Ä¢ <strong>1 Standard Lot</strong> = 100,000 units ‚Üí 1 pip ‚âà $10<br>
          ‚Ä¢ <strong>1 Mini Lot</strong> = 10,000 units ‚Üí 1 pip ‚âà $1<br>
          ‚Ä¢ <strong>1 Micro Lot</strong> = 1,000 units ‚Üí 1 pip ‚âà $0.10<br>
          ‚Ä¢ <strong>1 Nano Lot</strong> = 100 units ‚Üí 1 pip ‚âà $0.01
        </div>
      
        <h3>üîç Real-Life Example: What Does a 0.01 Lot Mean?</h3>
        <p>
          A lot size of <strong>0.01</strong> refers to a <strong>micro lot</strong>. That‚Äôs 1,000 units of the base currency. It‚Äôs a common size for beginners because it allows trading with lower risk.
        </p>
      
        <div class="example-box">
          <strong>Example:</strong><br>
          Let‚Äôs say you're trading <strong>EUR/USD</strong> with a 0.01 lot size.<br>
          That means you‚Äôre trading 1,000 EUR.<br>
          If the price moves by 1 pip (0.0001), you gain or lose approximately <strong>$0.10 per pip</strong>.<br><br>
      
          If the price moves 50 pips in your favor:<br>
          $0.10 √ó 50 = <strong>$5 profit</strong>.<br><br>
      
          If it moves 50 pips against you:<br>
          $0.10 √ó 50 = <strong>$5 loss</strong>.
        </div>
      
        <h3>üí° Intermediate Example: Trading 0.25 Lots</h3>
        <p>
          Suppose you‚Äôre using a <strong>0.25 lot size</strong> (which is a quarter of a standard lot = 25,000 units).
        </p>
      
        <div class="example-box">
          <strong>Example:</strong><br>
          If you trade 0.25 lots on EUR/USD:<br>
          Each pip is worth roughly $2.50.<br><br>
      
          A 20-pip profit = 20 √ó $2.50 = <strong>$50</strong><br>
          A 20-pip loss = 20 √ó $2.50 = <strong>$50</strong><br>
          <em>Risk and reward scale up with your lot size.</em>
        </div>
      
        <p>
          As you grow in experience, you'll learn how to choose the right lot size for your strategy and account balance. Start small, manage your risk, and always know how much you're risking per pip!
        </p>
    </section>
      

    <section>
      <h2>üîπ What is Leverage?</h2>
      <p><strong>Leverage</strong> allows you to control a larger position in the market with a smaller amount of your own capital. It‚Äôs expressed as a ratio ‚Äî such as <span class="highlight">1:50</span>, <span class="highlight">1:100</span>, or <span class="highlight">1:500</span>.</p>

      <p>If your leverage is 1:100, it means you can control $100,000 in the market with just $1,000 of your own money.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        If you have $1,000 in your account and use 1:100 leverage, you can trade up to $100,000.<br>
        If you use 1:500 leverage, you can control $500,000 with just $1,000 ‚Äî but the risk increases significantly.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è The Risk of High Leverage</h2>
      <p>Leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can magnify your profits, it also increases the potential for large losses. Many beginner traders make the mistake of using too much leverage, which can wipe out their accounts quickly.</p>

      <h3>Why is Leverage Risky?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A small movement in price against your position can lead to a large loss.</li>
        <li>High leverage reduces the margin of error in your trades.</li>
        <li>Brokers may issue a <strong>margin call</strong> or automatically close your trades if your losses exceed a certain level.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        Let‚Äôs say you have $100 and open a trade using 1:500 leverage (controlling $50,000).<br>
        If the market moves just <strong>20 pips</strong> against you, your account could be wiped out.<br>
        This is why professional traders use <strong>low leverage</strong> (e.g., 1:10 or 1:20) and apply <strong>strict risk management</strong>.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üìê Calculating Pip Value and Profit/Loss</h2>
      <p>To calculate the value of 1 pip, use this formula:</p>
      <p><strong>Pip Value = (1 pip / Exchange Rate) √ó Lot Size</strong></p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        You‚Äôre trading 1 standard lot (100,000) of EUR/USD at 1.1000:<br>
        Pip Value = (0.0001 / 1.1000) √ó 100,000 = $9.09 per pip<br><br>
        If the price moves 20 pips in your favor, your profit = 20 √ó $9.09 = <strong>$181.80</strong>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üß† Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pip</strong> is the smallest price movement. 1 pip = 0.0001 (or 0.01 for JPY pairs).</li>
        <li><strong>Lot</strong> defines trade size. Standard = 100k, Mini = 10k, Micro = 1k.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage</strong> lets you control big trades with small capital ‚Äî but increases risk.</li>
        <li>Use <strong>low leverage</strong> and <strong>risk management</strong> to protect your account.</li>
        <li>Understanding pip values helps you calculate your potential profit/loss accurately.</li>
      </ul>
