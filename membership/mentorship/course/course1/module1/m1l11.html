    <h2>Lesson 11: Understanding Margin and Margin Calls</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>üìå What is Margin in Forex Trading?</h2>
      <p><strong>Margin</strong> is the amount of money a trader needs to deposit with their broker to open a position. It acts like a security deposit that allows you to control a larger position than your account balance would normally permit.</p>
      <p>It is <span class="highlight">not a fee</span> or a cost; rather, it's a portion of your funds set aside while the trade is open.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        Suppose your broker requires a 2% margin and you want to open a trade worth $10,000. You would only need $200 (2% of $10,000) in your account to open this trade. The rest is effectively "borrowed" from the broker.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üìä What is Leverage?</h2>
      <p><strong>Leverage</strong> allows you to control a larger trade size with a smaller amount of capital. It is expressed as a ratio (e.g., 50:1, 100:1, or 500:1).</p>
      <p>Leverage amplifies both <span class="highlight">potential profits</span> and <span class="highlight">potential losses</span>.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        With a leverage of 100:1, you can control a position worth $100,000 with only $1,000 in your trading account.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üîÅ Difference Between Margin and Leverage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Margin</strong> is the actual amount you put down as a deposit.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage</strong> is the multiple of exposure you gain using that margin.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In simple terms: <span class="highlight">Margin is the money you use, leverage is the power it gives you.</span></p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Think of it like this:</strong><br>
        You want to buy a property worth $100,000. You only need to put down $10,000 as a deposit (margin), and the bank gives you the rest (leverage). But if the property value drops significantly, your $10,000 can be wiped out quickly‚Äîjust like in trading.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üìâ What is a Margin Call?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>margin call</strong> occurs when your account equity falls below the required margin level to maintain open positions. This means your trades are at risk due to losses, and your broker may ask you to deposit more funds or close out positions.</p>

      <p>Most brokers issue a margin call when your equity drops to a specific percentage of the used margin‚Äîoften around <span class="highlight">50% to 100%</span>.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        If you have $1,000 and open a trade requiring $500 margin, but the trade goes against you and your equity drops to $400, the broker might issue a margin call, asking you to top up your account or close trades.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üö® What Happens After a Margin Call?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may get a warning to deposit more funds.</li>
        <li>If you don‚Äôt respond, the broker may <span class="highlight">automatically close</span> your trades to prevent further losses.</li>
        <li>This process is known as a <strong>stop-out</strong> and protects the broker from you going into negative balance (though not always guaranteed).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>‚úÖ How to Avoid Margin Calls</h2>
      <h3>1. Use Lower Leverage</h3>
      <p>Using high leverage increases your exposure to risk. Opting for a lower leverage ratio gives your trade more room to breathe and reduces the chance of a margin call.</p>

      <h3>2. Monitor Your Trades Regularly</h3>
      <p>Keep an eye on your positions, especially when the market becomes volatile. Being aware of your equity and margin levels helps you act before a margin call is triggered.</p>

      <h3>3. Use Stop Loss Orders</h3>
      <p>Set <strong>stop losses</strong> to limit how much you're willing to lose on each trade. This ensures you exit trades automatically if the market moves against you too far.</p>

      <h3>4. Keep Extra Funds in Your Account</h3>
      <p>Maintaining a buffer of funds above your required margin level helps absorb losses and keeps your positions open longer.</p>

      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        If your trade requires $200 margin, try keeping at least $500‚Äì$1000 in your account to survive normal price fluctuations without getting a margin call.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üìö Real-Life Scenario: The Domino Effect</h2>
      <p>Imagine you used 1:500 leverage with $100 in your account. This gives you access to $50,000 in the market. A 0.2% unfavorable move (just 20 pips on a major pair) can wipe out your $100, causing a margin call or automatic stop-out. High leverage is risky and should be handled with caution.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üìå Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Margin</strong> is the deposit required to open a trade.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage</strong> amplifies your exposure in the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Margin calls</strong> occur when your losses reduce your equity below the required margin.</li>
        <li>Manage risk by using proper leverage, stop losses, and keeping extra funds in your account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding margin and leverage is fundamental for safe and profitable trading. Beginners should prioritize protecting their capital before seeking high profits.</p>
