    <h2>Lesson 1: What is the Forex Market?</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>üåç What is the Forex Market?</h2>
      <p>The <span class="highlight">foreign exchange market</span>, also known as <strong>Forex</strong> or <strong>FX</strong>, is the global marketplace for trading national currencies against one another.</p>
      <p>It is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, with a daily trading volume exceeding <strong>$7 trillion</strong> as of 2023. This means trillions of dollars are exchanged every day, involving banks, governments, businesses, investors, and traders from around the world.</p>
      <p>Unlike stock markets, the Forex market has no centralized location. It is conducted electronically over-the-counter (OTC), meaning all transactions occur via computer networks between traders globally.</p>
      <h3>üï∞Ô∏è A Brief History of the Forex Market</h3>
      <p>Foreign exchange has existed for thousands of years ‚Äî ever since people needed to exchange currencies to buy goods and services from other regions. But the modern Forex market began after the collapse of the <strong>Bretton Woods Agreement</strong> in the early 1970s.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1944:</strong> The Bretton Woods system was established to stabilize currency values, pegging them to gold.</li>
        <li><strong>1971:</strong> The U.S. abandoned the gold standard, causing the fixed currency exchange system to collapse.</li>
        <li><strong>1973:</strong> Currencies began to float freely against one another ‚Äî the birth of the modern Forex market.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Initially, Forex trading was only accessible to large institutions and governments. But with the rise of the internet and technology in the 1990s and 2000s, <strong>retail traders</strong> (like you) gained access through online brokers.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong> In the past, only big banks could trade currencies. Today, with as little as $10 and a smartphone, almost anyone can open a trading account and participate.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>üí± How It Works</h3>
      <p>When you trade Forex, you're always buying one currency and selling another ‚Äî this is called a <strong>currency pair</strong>.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong> If you're trading the pair <strong>EUR/USD</strong> and you buy, you're buying Euros and selling US Dollars. If EUR increases in value compared to USD, you profit.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>üìà Major Currency Pairs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EUR/USD</strong> ‚Äì Euro / US Dollar</li>
        <li><strong>GBP/USD</strong> ‚Äì British Pound / US Dollar</li>
        <li><strong>USD/JPY</strong> ‚Äì US Dollar / Japanese Yen</li>
        <li><strong>USD/CHF</strong> ‚Äì US Dollar / Swiss Franc</li>
        <li><strong>AUD/USD</strong> ‚Äì Australian Dollar / US Dollar</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are called <span class="highlight">major pairs</span> and are the most traded in the world due to their high liquidity and low spreads.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>üïí Forex Market Hours</h3>
      <p>The Forex market is open 24 hours a day, 5 days a week ‚Äî from Monday to Friday.</p>
      <p>It operates in 4 main trading sessions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>London Session</strong>: 8 AM ‚Äì 4 PM GMT</li>
        <li><strong>New York Session</strong>: 1 PM ‚Äì 9 PM GMT</li>
        <li><strong>Tokyo Session</strong>: 12 AM ‚Äì 8 AM GMT</li>
        <li><strong>Sydney Session</strong>: 10 PM ‚Äì 6 AM GMT</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Tip:</strong> The best time to trade is when two sessions overlap, like London + New York (1 PM ‚Äì 4 PM GMT) because of high volatility and volume.

    <section>
      <h3>üéì Beginner vs Intermediate Insight</h3>
      <p><strong>For Beginners:</strong> Think of Forex like exchanging money at a bureau when you travel. But instead of doing it once, traders do it thousands of times trying to profit from price changes.</p>
      <p><strong>For Intermediates:</strong> Start understanding <em>why</em> prices move ‚Äî central bank policy, news releases, liquidity zones, and market participants (retail, institutional, HFTs).</p>
