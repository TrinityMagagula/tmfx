    <h2>Lesson 8: Forex Trading Sessions (London, New York, Tokyo, Sydney)</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>üåç Introduction: What Are Forex Trading Sessions?</h2>
      <p>The Forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week. This is due to the fact that currencies are traded all over the world, and each financial center has its own working hours. These hours overlap, and this creates different trading sessions during the day.</p>
      <p>There are four major Forex trading sessions: London, New York, Tokyo, and Sydney. Each session has its own characteristics in terms of market activity, liquidity, and volatility. Understanding these sessions is crucial to making informed trading decisions and managing risk effectively.</p>
      <p>In this lesson, we will explore each session in detail, understand their timeframes, and learn how to make the most of the opportunities each session offers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>üåê The Four Major Forex Trading Sessions</h2>
      <p>The Forex market is divided into four major trading sessions, each corresponding to a specific region of the world. These sessions overlap, providing periods of higher liquidity and volatility, which creates both opportunities and risks for traders.</p>
      
      <h3>1. London Session (08:00 ‚Äì 16:00 GMT)</h3>
      <p>The London session is considered the most important Forex trading session, as it is the most active. This session is the largest in terms of trading volume and represents a significant portion of global Forex transactions. During this time, both European and U.S. markets are open, which creates increased liquidity and volatility.</p>
      <p>Since London is the financial hub of Europe, it has a major influence on currency movements. The London session often sets the tone for the rest of the trading day.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        When the London session opens, you may notice an increase in market activity, particularly with major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY. Traders react to news from Europe and the U.S., causing significant price movements.
      </div>

      <h3>2. New York Session (13:00 ‚Äì 21:00 GMT)</h3>
      <p>The New York session overlaps with the London session for a few hours, leading to even higher liquidity and volatility. The New York session is also one of the most active periods in the Forex market. Many of the economic reports and news releases that influence the market come from the U.S. during this session.</p>
      <p>This session is known for large price movements, particularly in USD pairs, as it coincides with the opening of the U.S. stock market.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        When the U.S. announces key economic data like Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) or GDP figures during the New York session, the market can experience rapid price fluctuations, especially with USD-based pairs like USD/JPY or EUR/USD.
      </div>

      <h3>3. Tokyo Session (00:00 ‚Äì 08:00 GMT)</h3>
      <p>The Tokyo session is the first session of the Forex trading day and it sets the pace for the market. While this session is smaller in terms of volume compared to the London and New York sessions, it is still significant due to Japan's strong influence on global trade and finance.</p>
      <p>During the Tokyo session, currency pairs that include the Japanese Yen (JPY) tend to see more activity, such as USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, and GBP/JPY.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A trader may focus on pairs like USD/JPY during the Tokyo session. If Japan releases economic reports, such as trade balance or manufacturing data, the JPY could move significantly.
      </div>

      <h3>4. Sydney Session (22:00 ‚Äì 06:00 GMT)</h3>
      <p>The Sydney session is the smallest and quietest of the four major sessions, but it still plays a vital role in providing liquidity during the early hours of the Forex market. While the trading volume during this session is lower, it can still offer opportunities, especially for traders looking to trade the Australian Dollar (AUD) and New Zealand Dollar (NZD).</p>
      <p>The Sydney session is also significant because it marks the start of the Forex trading day, and the market often experiences small price movements at the opening of this session.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        A trader might focus on AUD/USD or NZD/USD during the Sydney session. Any economic reports or news from Australia or New Zealand could lead to price action in these pairs.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>‚è∞ Overlap of Trading Sessions</h2>
      <p>When two trading sessions overlap, the Forex market experiences higher liquidity and volatility. The most significant overlap is between the London and New York sessions, which occurs from 13:00 ‚Äì 16:00 GMT. This period is often considered the best time to trade due to the increased market activity.</p>
      <p>Overlaps are ideal for traders because the higher liquidity allows for smoother entries and exits from trades. Furthermore, the increased volatility often results in larger price movements, presenting more trading opportunities.</p>
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong><br>
        During the London-New York overlap, you might notice major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY experiencing significant price swings. Traders who are able to time their trades correctly during this period can potentially profit from the market's volatility.
